                <p>Everyday when I wake up for school the first thing I see is salad rolled up 
                in a ball next to me.When I get up he too gets up and starts meowing for his food.
                He will not stop meowing until i feed him so thats usually the first thing I do.
                While im gone I have my mother take care of him for me, which she was hesitant at first.
                As soon as a come back home though,they'll usally be watching something on the couch together.</p>
