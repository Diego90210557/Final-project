                <h2>Home Life</h2>
                <p>Everyday when I wake up for school the first thing I see is salad rolled up 
                in a ball next to me.When I get up he too gets up and starts meowing for his food.
                He will not stop meowing until i feed him so thats usually the first thing I do.
                While im gone I have my mother take care of him for me, which she was hesitant at first.
                As soon as a come back home though,they'll usally be watching something on the couch together.</p>

                  <h3>Favorite things</h3>
                  <p>Some of salads favorite things to do is sun bathe as I like to call it, while looking at other
                  cats pass by.However he hates being outside unless its to eat grass, should've named him cow or moo instead.
                  Playing with his scracher in the middle of the night is something he does almost everynight which I call his 
                  crack hours, because its the time that he is mostly active and moving around.He also has a sister that my brother
                    adopted named stella, ever since he moved though, they haven't seen each other since.</p>
                </aside>
                  <h4>Family relations</h4>
                  <p>His relationship with my other famil members is pretty strong of course not a first, but it eventually
                  got to where it is today. My siblings adjusted to him quickly and got to interact with him more pretty 
                  fast. However with my parents it was different story, they didn't even want me to get him at all in the first place.
                  So when I brought him home for the first time he just stayed in my room for a week. After that, I was done avoiding
                  my parents so brought him to the living room. They still kinda kept a distance from him but when he would go up to 
                  them, they allowed him to sniff them.</p>
