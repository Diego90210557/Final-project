      <h2>Covid impact</h2>
      <p>The thought of getting a pet was not really even in my mind during late 2020 to 2021. It was still pretty in covid
      season so I had little to no interaction with the anyone outside of my house which left my social skills to deteriate.
      I had my family to talk to but that was pretty much it, I never talked to any of my firends in person. So when I got the
      oppurtunity to get a companion during that time I took it.</p>

        <h3>First pet</h3>
        <p>Salad was my first ever pet, before that my cousin that lived with me had a german shepard but I wouldnt really consider
        it my pet. I always wanted one when I was younger but my parents forbid it because they believed if I got one, they would have
        to take care of it since they thought I wouldn't be responsible with it. Which looking at it they were probabaly right being
        only 8-10 years old at the time. Also, my dad really just didn't like animals in general. To this day he doesn't interact with
        salad all that much.

      <h4>More than a pet</h4>
      <p>I see salad as more than just a pet, he is my best friend that has been with me for damn near 4 years now. Hes been there for
      me as much as i've been there for him. I don't care how much money he takes up, I will don aynthing within my power to cover his
      needs and wants along with some help from my parents covering certain expenses. This upcoming april he will be turning 4 years old
      or 32 in cat years. I can't wait to grow old together with him.</p>
