      <h2>Place of origin</h2>
      <p>Before I move foreward with salads life I will talk about his place of origin. He is a russian blue which
      originated somewhere in arkhangelsk(archangel)port around the 1860s. These cats were also known as archangel blues that 
      sailors would sometimes take with them to isles of great britain and northern europe.The first ever russian blue recorded
      in history was in a show at the crystal palace in england however, in 1885 Harrison Weir mistook the cat as a grey
      tabby instead.</p>

      <h3>breeding history</h3>
      <p>Most of the breadding period for russian blues was developed in england and scandanavia until world war 2.
      After the war, cross breeding with siamese cats was initated after so the lack of russian blue cats left.
      Though russian blue cats were already in the united states before the war, it wasn't until after that american
      breeders created the modern russian blue cat that we all see today. So would I really consider salad foreign I
      don't know, maybe his great grandparents were.</p>
