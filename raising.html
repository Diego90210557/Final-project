        <h2>First interaction</h2>
        <p>it was around april of 2021 when I got salad and it started with my sister telling me that her coworker just recently
        got kittens from her cat and was looking to give them out. A couple weeks later, me and my brother along with my sister
        go see them and at first glance they were all playful.Two stood out to me though, that was salad and stella. They were always 
        with each other so me and my brother decided to get one each.</p>

        <h3>First week home</h3>
        <p>When we got home we had to sneak them in because at the time my parnets didn't want pets in the house. Anytime my parents
        called for me I always closed the door to my room so he wouldn't get out, my brother did the same for stella. However, when 
        it came to them coming in our rooms we had to completley hide the cats. I often hid salad in the closet and my brother would
        hide stella in his bathroom. When our parents weren't in sight, we would go back to playing with them and helping them adjust
        to their new life.</p>

      <h4>Breaking out the news</h4>
      <p>When me and my brother finally built up the courage to take them out the room, we picked the worst day because there was family 
      over. We took salad and stella to the living room to just chill there and play. When our parents walked in they were more so 
      in disbelief then angry to the fact that we would actually get pets behind their backs. They kinda just talked about the responsibility,
      time, and money it would cost to care for them. Money wasn't an issue however, time was since I would be away for a couple hours for
      school. To this day it doesn't seem like it affected much.
